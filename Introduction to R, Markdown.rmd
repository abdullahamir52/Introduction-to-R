## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including a Hello world segment
This will include a **statement** that *prints* Hello world
```{r}
print("Hello World!")
```
# Trying to make a list

* **This is bold**
* *This is Italic*
* This is normal font
* ~~This is strikethrough~~
* [This is a link to my website](abdullahamir52@wordpress.com)
^[This is a footnote.]
* Try making your own list

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
